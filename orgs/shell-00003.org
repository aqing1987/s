#+TITLE: Be Careful when sourcing a script
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

* Bug Description
The story comes from my assistant for my colleague to debug an issue.

Process A Logic as below:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  while Process A does not get result Y from script ddcc.sh
        sh ddcc.sh

#+END_SRC

and the script logic for ddcc.sh as below:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  . /lib/ipp88x.sh
  local h=$(ipp88x_name)
  result=Y
#+END_SRC

The phenomenon is, Process A invoke ddcc.sh again and again, and
never stop.

* Reason
There is no file /lib/ipp88x.sh exist!
and when run the script ddcc.sh, the code below:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  . /lib/ipp88x.sh
#+END_SRC

will stop the script ddcc.sh and return error immediately! 
with error below:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ddcc.sh: .: line 3: can't open '/lib/ipp88x.sh'
#+END_SRC

and the code below will never reached
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  result=Y
#+END_SRC

* Background Knowledge
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  . MyScript
#+END_SRC
The execute command (a single period) followed by the name of the
script.

The difference between that and using the *sh* command is that
the *sh* command starts a new process and the execute command does
not.
