              Recent technological developments have turned Bluetooth beacons into<br  />
              a competitive tool for indoor navigation solutions. BLE beacons present<br  />
              significant opportunities for companies to better visitor experience and<br  />
              provide all-new opportunities through wayfinding. Beacons have applications in<br  />
              a diverse array of industries including retail, museums, and transport.<br  />

                Bluetooth is not the first technology to address the problem of wayfinding.<br  />
                Companies have used NFC, QR codes, and GPS to try to tackle it. Many of these<br  />
                solutions, however, have proven either ineffectual or impractical. GPS, though<br  />
                great for seveeral large-scale or outdoor scenariors, is not suitable to the<br  />
                indoors or more precise tracking.<br  />

                Wifi has become one of the most widespread platforms, and it is one obvious<br  />
                answer in proximity marketing. However, it does not necesarily offer the best<br  />
                foundation for wayfinding.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                There are three primary differences between WIFI and Bluetooth as used in<br  />
                indoor navigation.<br  />
              </p>

              <ul class="org-ul">
                <li>Modern WiFi-based systems generally require an entire infrastructure complete<br  />
                  with wired access points capable of receiving signals and determining position.<br  />
                  Beacons don't require this kind of infrastructure. WIth beacons, smartphones<br  />
                  can do all the heavy lifting. Even if you did use the smartphone in a WiFi-<br  />
                  based infrastructure, it would still not be practical as the signal strength<br  />
                  is most often adapted dynamically by the access points which makes it unusable<br  />
                  for a wayfinding system.<br  />
                </li>

                <li>This leads to the second defining factor: accuracy.<br  />
                  Accuracy with WiFi will rarely be better than 10 meters. For a lot of use<br  />
                  cases, that just isn't enough. On the other hand, Bluetooth-based solutions<br  />
                  can achieve 2-3 meter accuracy.<br  />
                </li>

                <li>Finally, indoor navigation with WiFi is not natively supported on iOS. Apps<br  />
                  on these phones cannot scan for a WiFi signal. They can't use trilateration<br  />
                  or fingerprinting methods used for indoor navigation. While it is possible<br  />
                  with Android, the instability of the signal will makes it impractical.
                </li>
