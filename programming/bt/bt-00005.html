              to turn on and of the LED connected to Pin 13 from a smartphone. You create a<br  />

              Bluetooth 4.0 includes both traditional Bluetooth, now labeled "Bluetooth Classic",<br  />
              and the new Bluetooth Low Energy(Bluetooth LE, or BLE). BLE is optimized for low<br  />
              power use at low data rates, and was designed to operate from simple lithium coin<br  />
              cell batteries.<br  />
            </p>

            <p>
              Unlike standard bluetooth communication basically based on an asynchronous serial<br  />
              connection (UART) a Bluetooth LE radio acts like a community bulletin board. The<br  />
              computers that connect to it are like community members that read the bulletin<br  />
              board. Each radio acts as either the bulletin board or the reader. If your radio<br  />
              is a bulletin board (called a peripheral device in Bluetooth LE parlance) it<br  />
              posts data for all radios in the community to read. If your radio is a reader<br  />
              (called a central device in Bluetooth LE terms) it reads from any of the bulletin<br  />
              boards (peripheral devices) that have information about which it cares. You can<br  />
              also think of peripheral devices as the servers in a client-server transaction,<br  />
              because they contain the information that reader radios ask for. Similarly,<br  />
              central devices are the clients of the Bluetooth LE world because they read<br  />
              information available from the peripherals.<br  />
            </p>

            <p>
              Think of a Bluetooth LE peripheral device as a bulletin board and central devices<br  />
              as viewers of the board. Central devices view the services, get the data, then<br  />
              move on. Each transaction is quick(a few milliseconds), so multiple central<br  />
              devices can get data from one peripheral. (Note that: if the peripheral has been<br  />
              connected by one central, other central devices will not see it.)<br  />
            </p>

            <p>
              The information presented by a peripheral is structured as <b>services</b>, each of<br  />
              which is subdivided into <b>characteristics</b>. You can think of services as the<br  />
              notices on a bulletin board, and characteristics as the individual paragraphs<br  />
              of those notices. If you're a peripheral device, you just update each service<br  />
              characteristic when it needs updating and don't worry about whether the central<br  />
              devices read them or not. If you're a central device, you connect to the<br  />
              peripheral then read the boxes you want. If a given characteristic is readable<br  />
              and writable, then the peripheral and central can both change it.<br  />

              <p>
                The Bluetooth LE specification includes a mechanism known as <b>notify</b> that lets<br  />
                you know when data's changed. When notify on a characteristic is enabled and the<br  />
                sender writes to it, the new value is automatically sent to the receiver, without<br  />
                the receiver explicitly issuing a read command. This is commonly used for streaming<br  />
                data such as accelerometer or other sensor readings. There's a variation on this<br  />
                specification called <b>indicate</b> which works similarly, but in the indicate spe-<br  />
                cification, the reader sends an acknowledgement of the pushed data.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                The client-server structure of Bluetooth LE, combined with the notify characteristic,<br  />
                is generally called a <b>publish-and-subscribe-model</b>.<br  />

                Your peripheral should update characteristics when there's a significant change<br  />
                to them. For example, when a switch changes from off to on, update its characteristic.<br  />
                When an analog sensor changes by a significant amount, update its characteristic.<br  />
                Just as with writing to a characteristic, you could update your characteristics<br  />
                on a regular interval, but this wastes processing power and energy if the<br  />
                characteristic has not changed.<br  />

                A BLE peripheral will provide <b>services</b>, which in turn provide <b>characteristics</b>.<br  />
                You can define your own services, or use standard services.<br  />

              </p>

              <p>
                Services are identified by unique numbers known as UUIDs. You know about UUIDs<br  />
                from other contexts. Standard services have a 16-bit UUID and custom services<br  />
                have a 128-bit. The ability to define services and characteristics depends on<br  />
                the radio you're using and its firmware.<br  />

                A characteristic value can be up to 20 bytes long. This is a key constraint in<br  />
                designing services. Given this limit, you should consider how best to store<br  />
                data about your sensors and actuators most effectively for your application.<br  />
                The simplest design pattern is to store one sensor or actuator value per<br  />
                characteristic, in ASCII encoded values.<br  />

                This is also the most expensive in memory terms, and would take the longest to<br  />
                read. But it's the simplest for development and debugging.<br  />
                You could also combine readings into a single characteristic, when a given sensor<br  />
                or actuator has associated with it.<br  />

                <li>Read: ask the peripheral to send back the current value of the characteristic.<br  />

                BLE devices let other devices know that they exist by advertising using the<br  />
                <b>General Access Profile (GAP)</b>. Adverting packets can contain a device name,<br  />
                some other information, and also a list of the services it provides.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                Advertising packets have a limited size. You will only be able to fit a single<br  />
                128-bit service UUID in the packet. Make sure the device name is not too long,<br  />
                or you won't even be able to fit that.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                You can provide additional services that are not advertised. Central devices<br  />
                will learn about these through the connection/bonding process. Non-advertised<br  />
                services cannot be used to discover devices, though. Sometimes this is not an<br  />
                issue. For example, you may have a custom peripheral device with a custom<br  />
                service, but in your central device app you may know that it also provides the<br  />
                Battery Service and other services.<br  />

                The Bluetooth LE protocol operates on multiple layers. <b>General Attribute Profile (GATT)</b><br  />
                is the layer that defines services and characteristics and enables read/write/<br  />
                notify/indicate operations on them. When reading more about GATT, you may encounter<br  />
                GATT concepts of a "server" and "client". These don't always correspond to central<br  />
                and peripherals. In most cases, though, the peripheral is the GATT server (since<br  />
                it provides the services and characteristics), while the central is the GATT client.<br  />
