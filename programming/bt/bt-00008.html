                <p>
                  The Generic Access Service contains generic information about the device. All<br  />
                  available Characteristics are readonly. You can recognize a characteristic holding<br  />
                  the device name "OurService". The second characteristic holds the appearance value.<br  />
                  The third characteristic holds various parameters used to establish a connection.<br  />
                  You can recognise values from the #defines in the example called: MIN_CONN_INTERVAL,<br  />
                  MAX_CONN_INTERVAL, SLAVE_LATENCY, and CONN_SUP_TIMEOUT.<br  />
                </p>

                <p>
                  The connection parameters for a BLE connection is a set of parameters that determine<br  />
                  when and how the Central and a Peripheral in a link transmits data. It is always<br  />
                  the Central that actually sets the connection parameters used, but the Peripheral<br  />
                  can send a so-called Connection Parameter Update Request, that the Central can<br  />
                  then accept or reject.<br  />
                </p>

                <p>
                  There are basically three different parameters:<br  />
                </p>
                <ul class="org-ul">
                  <li>Connection interval<br  />
                    Determines how often the Central will ask for data from the peripheral. When<br  />
                    the Peripheral requests an update, it supplies a maximum and a minimum wanted<br  />
                    interval. The connection interval must be between 7.5ms and 4s.<br  />
                  </li>
                  <li>Slave latency<br  />
                    By setting a non-zero slave latency, the Peripheral can choose to not answer<br  />
                    when the Central asks for data up to the slave latency number of times. However,<br  />
                    if the Peripheral has data to send, it can choose to send data at any time. This<br  />
                    enables a peripheral to stay sleeping for a longer time, if it doesn't have data<br  />
                    to send, but still send data fast if needed. The text book example of such<br  />
                    device is for example keyboard and mice, which want to be sleeping for as long<br  />
                    as possible when there is no data to send, but still have low latency (and for<br  />
                    the mouse: low connection interval) when needed.<br  />
                  </li>
                  <li>Connection supervision timeout<br  />
                    This timeout determines the timeout from the last data exchange till a link is<br  />
                    considered lost. A central will not start trying to reconnect before the timeout<br  />
                    has passed, so if you have a device which goes in and out of range often, and<br  />
                    you need to notice when that happens, it might make sense to have a short timeout.<br  />
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  For a BLE link the connection parameters control the frequency at which data can<br  />
                  be exchanged between the peripheral and central once a BLE link has been established<br  />
                  between the two. These parameters are negotiated between the central and peripheral<br  />
                  during link establishment.<br  />
                </p>

                <p>
                  The connection interval and slave latency typically affect the performance of a<br  />
                  BLE link the most. The lower the slave latency and faster the connection interval<br  />
                  the faster the effective data transfer rate between the peripheral and central.<br  />
                  On the other hand this also leads to higher average current consumption in the<br  />
                  peripheral.<br  />
                </p>

                  The second service is the Generic Attribute Service. Simply put, this service can<br  />
                  be used to notify the central of changes made to the fundamental structure of services<br  />
                  and characteristics on the peripheral.<br  />

                  First of all we need a place to store all data and information relevant to our<br  />

                  our_service.h. The <b>service_handle</b> is a number identifying this particular<br  />
                  service and is assigned by the SoftDevice. Declare a variable called <b>m_our_service</b><br  />
                  of type <b>ble_os_t</b> in main.c so that we can pass it to various functions and<br  />
                  have complete control of our service.<br  />

                  It takes a pointer to a <b>ble_os_t</b> struct as a parameter so make sure that you<br  />

                <p>
                  Look up the definition of <b>our_service_init()</b> in our_service.c. We create a UUID<br  />
                  for our service. Since we are going to make a custom service we will use the<br  />
                  defined base UUID together with a 16-bit UUID.<br  />
                </p>

                <p>
                  add code below:<br  />
                </p>
                <div class="org-src-container">

                  <pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #66D9EF;">uint32_t</span>   <span style="color: #FD971F;">err_code</span>;

                </div>
                <p>
                  What this code does is to create two variables. One will hold our 16-bit service<br  />
                  UUID and the other the base UUID. In the fourth line we add our vendor specific<br  />
                  UUID (hence the 'vs') to a table of UUIDs in the BLE stack.<br  />
                </p>

                <p>
                  Using a vendor specific UUID is basically a two-step process<br  />
                </p>
                <ul class="org-ul">
                  <li>add your custom base UUID to the stack<br  />
                    by using sd_ble_uuid_vs_add(). store the value returned to you in the p_type<br  />
                    parameter of this function call.<br  />
                  </li>
                  <li>set the type of all ble_uuid_t<br  />
                    that should use this base to the value returned to you from sd_ble_uuid_vs_add()<br  />
                    When you set this field to your custom type instead of to BLE_UUID_TYPE_BLE, the<br  />
                    value will be used on top of the custom base UUID you specified instead of on<br  />
                    top of the Bluetooth SIG base.<br  />
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Behind the scenes, sd_ble_uuid_vs_add() will add the base UUID to the SoftDevice's<br  />
                  internal list of base UUIDs, and return the table index for this UUID in the type<br  />
                  field. When using the type in a ble_uuid_t later, the SoftDevice can look up the<br  />
                  base used in this same table by using this index.<br  />
                </p>

                  parameter we specify that we want a primary service. The other option here is<br  />
                  to use BLE_GATTS_SRVC_TYPE_SECONDARY to create a secondary service. The use of<br  />
                  secondary services are rare, but sometimes used to nest services inside other<br  />
                  services. The second parameter is a pointer to the service UUID that we created.<br  />

                  You can recognize the base UUID from the <b>#define in our_service.h</b> and if you<br  />

                  When you connect to your device using nRF Connect. some events occur in the BLE<br  />
                  stack.<br  />
                  The first event is a Generic Access Profile(GAP) event, BLE_GAP_EVT_CONNECTED,<br  />

                  If you ever make an application that has several connections you will get several<br  />

                In other words, it is a set of rules describing how to bundle, present and<br  />
                transfer data using BLE. Read Bluetooth Core Specification v5.0, vol.3 Part G.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                The Generic Attributes (GATT) define a hierarchical data structure that is<br  />
                exposed to connected BLE devices. GATT profiles enable extensive innovation<br  />
                while still maintaining full interoperability with other Bluetooth devices.<br  />
                The profile describes a use case, roles and general behaviors based on the GATT<br  />
                functionality. Services are collections of characteristics and relationships<br  />
                to other services that encapsulate the behavior of part of a device. This also<br  />
                includes hierarchy of services, characteristics and attributes used in the attribute<br  />
                server.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                GATT is built on top of the Attribute Protocol (ATT), which uses GATT data to<br  />
                define the way that two Bluetooth Low Energy devices send and receive standard<br  />
                messages. Note that GATT is not used in Bluetooth BR/EDR implementations, which<br  />
                use only adopted profiles.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                The top level of the hierarchy is a profile, which is composed of one or more<br  />
                services necessary to fulfill a use case. A service is composed of characteristics<br  />
                or references to other services.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                GATT groups these services to encapsulate the behavior of part of a device, and<br  />
                describes a use case, roles and general behaviors based on the GATT functionality.<br  />

                The Bluetooth Core Specification defines a service like this:<br  />

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  A service is a collection of data and associated behaviors to accomplish a<br  />
                  particular function or feature. A service definition may contain mandatory<br  />
                  characteristics and optional characteristics.<br  />

              <p>
                In Other words, a service is a collection of information, like e.g. values of<br  />
                sensors. Bluetooth SIG has predefined certain services. For example they have<br  />
                defined a service called Heart Rate service. The reason why they have done this<br  />
                is to make it easier for developers to make apps and firmware compatible with<br  />
                the standard Heart Rate service. However, this does not mean that you can't make<br  />
                your own heart rate sensor based on your own ideas and service structures.<br  />

                  is displayed or represented.<br  />

              </blockquote>

              <p>
                In other words, the characteristic is where the actual values and information is<br  />
                presented. Security parameters, units and other metadata concerning the information<br  />
                are also encapsulated in the characteristics.<br  />

                An analogy might be a storage room filled with filing cabinets and each filing<br  />
                cabinet has a number of drawers. The GATT profile in this analogy is the storage<br  />
                room. The cabinets are the services, and the drawers are characteristics holding<br  />
                various information. Some of the drawers might also have locks on them restricting<br  />
                the access to its information.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                Imagine a heart rate monitor watch for example. Watches like this typically use<br  />
                at least two services:<br  />
              </p>

              <ul class="org-ul">
                <li>A Heart rate service. It encapsulates three characteristics:<br  />
                  <ul class="org-ul">
                    <li>A mandatory Heart Rate Measurement characteristic holding the heart rate value.<br  />
                    </li>
                    <li>An optional Body Sensor Location characteristic.<br  />
                    </li>
                    <li>A conditional Heart Rate Control Point characteristic.<br  />
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>A Battery service<br  />

                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Now why bother with this? Why not just send whatever data you need directly<br  />
                without the fuzz of bundling it in characteristics and services? The reasons are<br  />
                flexibility, efficiency, cross platform compatibilities and ease of implementation.<br  />
                When iPhones, Android tablets or Windows laptops discover a device advertising a<br  />
                heart rate service they can be 100% sure to find at least the heart rate measurement<br  />
                characteristic and the characteristic is guaranteed to be presented in a standardized<br  />
                way. If a device contains more than one service you are free to pick and choose<br  />
                the services and characteristics you like. By bundling information this way devices<br  />
                can quickly discover what information is available and communicate only what is<br  />
                strictly needed and thereby save precious time and energy. Remember that BLE is<br  />
                all about low energy.<br  />

                To continue the analogy: the storage room is located in a small business office<br  />
                and has two filing cabinets. The first cabinet is used by the accountants. The<br  />
                drawers contain files with financial details of the business, sorted by date.<br  />
                The drawers are locked and only the accountants and the upper management have<br  />
                access to them. The second cabinet is used by Human Resources and contains records<br  />
                over the employees, sorted in alphabetical order. These drawers are also locked<br  />
                and only HR and upper management have access to them. Everyone in the business<br  />
                knows where the storage room is and what it is for, but only some people have<br  />
                access to it and use it. It ensures efficiency, security and order.<br  />

                A UUID is an abbreviation you will see a lot in the BLE world. It is a unique<br  />
                number used to identify services, characteristics and descriptors, also known as<br  />
                attributes. These IDs are transmitted over the air so that e.g. a peripheral can<br  />
                inform a central what services it provides. To save transmitting air time and<br  />
                memory space in your nRF51 there are two kinds of UUIDs.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                The first type is a short 16-bit UUID. The predefined Heart rate service, e.g.,<br  />
                has the UUID 0x180D and one of its enclosed characteristics, the Heart Rate<br  />
                Measurement characteristic, has the UUID 0x2A37. The 16-bit UUID is energy and<br  />
                memory efficient, but since it only provides a relatively limited number of<br  />
                unique IDs there is a rule; you can only transmit the predefined Bluetooth SIG<br  />
                UUIDs directly over the air. Hence there is a need for a second type of UUID<br  />
                so you can transmit your own custom UUIDs as well.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                The second type is a 128-bit UUID, sometimes referred to as a vendor specific<br  />
                UUID. This is the type of UUID you need to use when you are making your own<br  />
                custom services and characteristics. It looks something like this:<br  />
                4A98xxxx-1CC4-E7C1-C757-F1267DD021E8 and is called the "base UUID". The four x's<br  />
                represent a field where you will insert your own 16-bit IDs for your custom<br  />
                services and characteristics and use them just like a predefined UUID. This way<br  />
                you can store the base UUID once in memory, forget about it, and work with 16-bit<br  />
                IDs as normal. You can generate base UUIDs using nRFgo Studio.<br  />
              </p>

              <p>
                A little fun fact about UUIDs: There is no database ensuring that no one in the<br  />
                world is sharing the same UUID.<br  />

                GATT defines client and server roles. GATT procedures can be considered to be<br  />
                split into three basic types: Discovery procedures, Client-initiated procedures<br  />
                and Server-initiated procedures. The GATT server stores the data transported<br  />
                over the ATT and accepts ATT requests, commands and confirmations from the GATT<br  />
                client. The GATT server sends responses to requests and sends indications and<br  />
                notifications asynchronously to the GATT client when specified events occur on<br  />
                the GATT server. GATT also specifies the format of data contained on the GATT<br  />
                server.<br  />
